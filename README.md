# prework-study-guide

## Description

What - preparing for a bootcamp course that will provide opportunities to switch career paths.
Why - to better understand the tools that will be used through this course and beyond! The knowledge I had prior to this prework would not have resulted in success in this course.
How - through the use of videos, articles, trial, error, and repetition we learned the basics of coding and put ourselves in a position to succeed.
